### <a name="1"></a> Layout Exercise Project
 
- Hey, this is my first project in Kotlin.
- As UI design, I used the completed user interface in the link given to me. [UI Design](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/4762-design-courses-app-sketch-freebie-resource.html)
- My project has 3 screens.
- Main Screen, Login Screen and Premium promotion screen.
- On the second page, which is login screen, I used TextStyle Button for the sign up option.
