### <a name="1"></a> Tween Animation Exercise Project
 
- This is my animation exercise project which I used ViewAnimation.
- The moon icon that I added to my user interface design moves according to the defined animation features when the button is pressed.
- I donwloaded the .svg icons from google.
- You can find the icons I use and more from here [Icons](https://www.svgrepo.com/)
